NFL Team ELO Rating System using Poisson Model
==============================================

This script implements an ELO rating system for NFL teams using a Poisson model
based on their historical performance. The model considers:
- Offensive and defensive scoring rates
- Game outcomes and margins
- Strength of schedule adjustments
- Home field advantage
