Improved Monte Carlo Model with Performance Enhancements
=========================================================

This enhanced version includes:
1. Rolling/incremental training (updates with in-season data)
2. Bayesian updating (combines prior seasons with current season)
3. Regression to the mean (handles early-season variance)
4. Matchup-specific adjustments (division games, etc.)
5. Confidence-based predictions (skip low-confidence predictions)
6. Ensemble variance (multiple distribution types)
7. Recency decay (exponential rather than linear)
8. Minimum sample size handling
9. Team-specific variance modeling
10. Outlier detection and handling

These improvements specifically target weeks with poor performance.
